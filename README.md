# slipstream

An addon manger for World of Warcraft

![](screenshot.png)

slipstream is an alternative to the official Curse addon client in early development. It was created primarily for my own use and as a means to learn the underlying frameworks.

## Things that work
- Search, install, and update from CurseForge.
- Bulk update.
- Deletion.
- Retail and Classic.
- Windows and OSX.

## Things that don't work (but may soon)
- Addon detection: slipstream can only see the addons it has installed.
- Integration with other addon repositories: TukUI, WowInterface, etc.

## Things that don't work (and probably never will)
- Detection of modified addons.
- Alternate (alpha/beta) CurseForge release channels.
